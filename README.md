# PersonalAssistant
This is a Personal Assistant app that tracks Birthdays, to-do lists and contacts. The user is able to get, add and remove birthdays, to-do items and contacts. This project was good practice for understanding OOP, using classes, functions, and creating json files, reading and writing to files.
